# naturalLanguageProcessing
Beginning of natural language processing project. 

###Goal
Predict the accuracy of news based on keywords/phrases. Learn to extract data and get the algorithm to differentiate between object/verb in a sentence. This is NOT good right now. 

Using primarily the SpaCy python module, NLTK, and Scikit-learn and trying to reference Dataquest to help me.
