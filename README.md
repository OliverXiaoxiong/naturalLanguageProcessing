# naturalLanguageProcessing
Beginning of natural language processing project. 

### Goal
Learn natural language processing. 
Predict the accuracy of news based on keywords/phrases. 
One method is to differentiate between object/verb in a sentence in the title of the article. 

Still pretty sucky. 

Using primarily the SpaCy python module, NLTK, and Scikit-learn.
